# Alarm-Clock-Frontend-Project
 This Application Project focusses on the design an alarm clock to notify and alert the user of the alarms he/she sets.
## Alarm Clock Frontend Web Application<br/>
This is a simple Alarm Clock web application that allows users to set alarms, view the list of upcoming alarms, and delete alarms. The application displays the current time, and when an alarm goes off, it triggers an alert in the browser.<br/>

## Features<br/>
1) Clock Face: The clock displays the current time, updating seconds, minutes, and hours as time changes.<br/>

2) Set Alarm: Users can set an alarm by providing the desired hour, minute, second, and AM/PM. Clicking the "Set Alarm" button will add the alarm to the list in the top to bottom fashion like the newly set alarm after the alarm set previously.<br/>

3) Alarms List: A list displaying all the alarms set by the user.<br/>

4) Delete Alarm: Each alarm in the list has a delete button. Users can click the button to remove the alarm from the list. Deleting an alarm does not trigger an alert.<br/>
